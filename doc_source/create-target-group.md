# Create a target group<a name="create-target-group"></a>

You register your targets with a target group\. By default, the load balancer sends requests to registered targets using the port and protocol that you specified for the target group\. You can override this port when you register each target with the target group\.

After you create a target group, you can add tags\.

To route traffic to the targets in a target group, specify the target group in an action when you create a listener or create a rule for your listener\. For more information, see [Listener rules](load-balancer-listeners.md#listener-rules)\.

You can add or remove targets from your target group at any time\. For more information, see [Register targets with your target group](target-group-register-targets.md)\. You can also modify the health check settings for your target group\. For more information, see [Modify the health check settings of a target group](target-group-health-checks.md#modify-health-check-settings)\.

#### [ New console ]

**To create a target group using the new console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **LOAD BALANCING**, choose **Target Groups**\.

1. Choose **Create target group**\.

1. For **Choose a target type**, select **Instances** to register targets by instance ID, **IP addresses** to register targets by IP address, or **Lambda function** to register a Lambda function as a target\.

1. For **Target group name**, type a name for the target group\. This name must be unique per region per account, can have a maximum of 32 characters, must contain only alphanumeric characters or hyphens, and must not begin or end with a hyphen\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Protocol** and **Port**, modify the default values as needed\.

1. If the target type is **IP addresses**, choose **IPv4** or **IPv6** as the **IP address type**, otherwise skip to the next step\.

   Note that only targets that have the selected IP address type can be included in this target group\. The IP address type cannot be changed after the target group is created\.

1. For **VPC**, select a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. Note that for **IP addresses** target types, the VPCs available for selection are those that support the **IP address type** that you chose in the previous step\. 

1. \(Optional\) For **Protocol version**, modify the default value as needed\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Health checks** section, modify the default settings as needed\.

1. If the target type is **Lambda function**, you can enable health checks by selecting **Enable** in the **Health checks** section\.

1. \(Optional\) Add one or more tags as follows:

   1. Expand the **Tags** section\.

   1. Choose **Add tag**\.

   1. Enter the tag key and the tag value\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add one or more targets as follows:
   + If the target type is **Instances**, select one or more instances, enter one or more ports, and then choose **Include as pending below**\.
   + If the target type is **IP addresses**, do the following:

     1. Select a network **VPC** from the list, or choose **Other private IP addresses**\.

     1. Enter the IP address manually, or find the IP address using instance details\. You can enter up to five IP addresses at a time\.

     1. Enter the ports for routing traffic to the specified IP addresses\. 

     1. Choose **Include as pending below**\. 
   + If the target type is a **Lambda function**, specify a single Lambda function or omit this step and specify a Lambda function later\.

1. Choose **Create target group**\.

1. \(Optional\) You can specify the target group in a listener rule\. For more information, see [Listener Rules](listener-update-rules.md)\.

#### [ Old console ]

**To create a target group using the old console**

1. For **Target type**, select **Instance** to register targets by instance ID, **IP** to register IP addresses, and **Lambda function** to register a Lambda function\.

1. If the target type is **Instance** or **IP**, do the following:

   1. \(Optional\) For **Protocol** and **Port**, modify the default values as needed\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Protocol version**, modify the default value as needed\.

   1. For **VPC**, select a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\.

1. If the target type is **Lambda function**, do the following:

   1. For **Lambda function**, do one of the following:
      + Select the Lambda function
      + Create a new Lambda function and select it
      + Register the Lambda function after you create the target group

   1. \(Optional\) To enable health checks, choose **Health check**, **Enable**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Health check settings** and **Advanced health check settings**, modify the default settings as needed\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add one or more tags as follows:

   1. Select the newly created target group\.

   1. On the **Tags** tab, choose **Add/Edit Tags**\.

   1. On the **Add/Edit Tags** page, for each tag you add, choose **Create Tag** and then specify the tag key and tag value\. When you have finished adding tags, choose **Save**\.

1. \(Optional\) To add targets to the target group, see [Register targets with your target group](target-group-register-targets.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) You can specify the target group in a listener rule\. For more information, see [Listener Rules](listener-update-rules.md)\.
