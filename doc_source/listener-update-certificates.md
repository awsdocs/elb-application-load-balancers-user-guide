## Replace the default certificate<a name="replace-default-certificate"></a>

You can replace the default certificate for your listener using the following procedure\. For more information, see [SSL certificates](create-https-listener.md#https-listener-certificates)\.

**To change the default certificate using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **LOAD BALANCING**, choose **Load Balancers**\.

1. Select the load balancer and choose **Listeners**\.

1. Select the check box for the listener and choose **Edit**\.

1. For **Default SSL certificate**, do one of the following:
   + If you created or imported a certificate using AWS Certificate Manager, choose **From ACM** and choose the certificate\.
   + If you uploaded a certificate using IAM, choose **From IAM** and choose the certificate\.

1. Choose **Update**\.

**To change the default certificate using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [modify\-listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/modify-listener.html) command\.

## Add certificates to the certificate list<a name="add-certificates"></a>

You can add certificates to the certificate list for your listener using the following procedure\. When you first create an HTTPS listener, the certificate list is empty\. You can add one or more certificates\. You can optionally add the default certificate to ensure that this certificate is used with the SNI protocol even if it is replaced as the default certificate\. For more information, see [SSL certificates](create-https-listener.md#https-listener-certificates)\.

**To add certificates to the certificate list using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **LOAD BALANCING**, choose **Load Balancers**\.

1. Select the load balancer and choose **Listeners**\.

1. For the HTTPS listener to update, choose **View/edit certificates**, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener\.

1. Choose the **Add certificates** icon \(the plus sign\) in the menu bar, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates managed by ACM and IAM\. If you've already added a certificate to the listener, its check box is selected and disabled\.

1. To add certificates that are already managed by ACM or IAM, select the check boxes for the certificates and choose **Add**\.

1. If you have a certificate that isn't managed by ACM or IAM, import it to ACM and add it to your listener as follows:

   1. Choose **Import certificate**\.

   1. For **Certificate private key**, paste the PEM\-encoded, unencrypted private key for the certificate\.

   1. For **Certificate body**, paste the PEM\-encoded certificate\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Certificate chain**, paste the PEM\-encoded certificate chain\.

   1. Choose **Import**\. The newly imported certificate appears in the list of available certificates and is selected\.

   1. Choose **Add**\.

1. To leave this screen, choose the **Back to the load balancer** icon \(the back button\) in the menu bar\.

**To add a certificate to the certificate list using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [add\-listener\-certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/add-listener-certificates.html) command\.

## Remove certificates from the certificate list<a name="remove-certificates"></a>

You can remove certificates from the certificate list for an HTTPS listener using the following procedure\. To remove the default certificate for an HTTPS listener, see [Replace the default certificate](#replace-default-certificate)\.

**To remove certificates from the certificate list using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **LOAD BALANCING**, choose **Load Balancers**\.

1. Select the load balancer and choose **Listeners**\.

1. For the listener to update, choose **View/edit certificates**, which displays the default certificate followed by any other certificates that you've added to the listener\.

1. Choose the **Remove certificates** icon \(the minus sign\) in the menu bar\.

1. Select the check boxes for the certificates and choose **Remove**\.

1. To leave this screen, choose the **Back to the load balancer** icon \(the back button\) in the menu bar\.

**To remove a certificate from the certificate list using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [remove\-listener\-certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/remove-listener-certificates.html) command\.

## Update the security policy<a name="update-security-policy"></a>

When you create an HTTPS listener, you can select the security policy that meets your needs\. When a new security policy is added, you can update your HTTPS listener to use the new security policy\. Application Load Balancers do not support custom security policies\. For more information, see [Security policies](create-https-listener.md#describe-ssl-policies)\.

**To update the security policy using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, under **LOAD BALANCING**, choose **Load Balancers**\.

1. Select the load balancer and choose **Listeners**\.

1. Select the check box for the HTTPS listener and choose **Edit**\.

1. For **Security policy**, choose a security policy\.

1. Choose **Update**\.

**To update the security policy using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [modify\-listener](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elbv2/modify-listener.html) command\.
