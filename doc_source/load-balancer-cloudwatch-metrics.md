# CloudWatch metrics for your Application Load Balancer<a name="load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

Elastic Load Balancing publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your load balancers and your targets\. CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time\-series data, known as *metrics*\. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor, and the data points as the values of that variable over time\. For example, you can monitor the total number of healthy targets for a load balancer over a specified time period\. Each data point has an associated time stamp and an optional unit of measurement\.

You can use metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected\. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor a specified metric and initiate an action \(such as sending a notification to an email address\) if the metric goes outside what you consider an acceptable range\.

Elastic Load Balancing reports metrics to CloudWatch only when requests are flowing through the load balancer\. If there are requests flowing through the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing measures and sends its metrics in 60\-second intervals\. If there are no requests flowing through the load balancer or no data for a metric, the metric is not reported\.

For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

## Metric dimensions for Application Load Balancers<a name="load-balancer-metric-dimensions-alb"></a>

To filter the metrics for your Application Load Balancer, use the following dimensions\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| AvailabilityZone |  Filters the metric data by Availability Zone\.  | 
| LoadBalancer |  Filters the metric data by load balancer\. Specify the load balancer as follows: app/*load\-balancer\-name*/*1234567890123456* \(the final portion of the load balancer ARN\)\.  | 
| TargetGroup |  Filters the metric data by target group\. Specify the target group as follows: targetgroup/*target\-group\-name*/*1234567890123456* \(the final portion of the target group ARN\)\.  | 

## Statistics for Application Load Balancer metrics<a name="metric-statistics"></a>

CloudWatch provides statistics based on the metric data points published by Elastic Load Balancing\. Statistics are metric data aggregations over specified period of time\. When you request statistics, the returned data stream is identified by the metric name and dimension\. A dimension is a name\-value pair that uniquely identifies a metric\. For example, you can request statistics for all the healthy EC2 instances behind a load balancer launched in a specific Availability Zone\.

The `Minimum` and `Maximum` statistics reflect the minimum and maximum reported by the individual load balancer nodes\. For example, suppose there are 2 load balancer nodes\. One node has `HealthyHostCount` with a `Minimum` of 2, a `Maximum` of 10, and an `Average` of 6, while the other node has `HealthyHostCount` with a `Minimum` of 1, a `Maximum` of 5, and an `Average` of 3\. Therefore, the load balancer has a `Minimum` of 1, a `Maximum` of 10, and an `Average` of about 4\.

The `Sum` statistic is the aggregate value across all load balancer nodes\. Because metrics include multiple reports per period, `Sum` is only applicable to metrics that are aggregated across all load balancer nodes\.

The `SampleCount` statistic is the number of samples measured\. Because metrics are gathered based on sampling intervals and events, this statistic is typically not useful\. For example, with `HealthyHostCount`, `SampleCount` is based on the number of samples that each load balancer node reports, not the number of healthy hosts\.

A percentile indicates the relative standing of a value in a data set\. You can specify any percentile, using up to two decimal places \(for example, p95\.45\)\. For example, the 95th percentile means that 95 percent of the data is below this value and 5 percent is above\. Percentiles are often used to isolate anomalies\. For example, suppose that an application serves the majority of requests from a cache in 1\-2 ms, but in 100\-200 ms if the cache is empty\. The maximum reflects the slowest case, around 200 ms\. The average doesn't indicate the distribution of the data\. Percentiles provide a more meaningful view of the application's performance\. By using the 99th percentile as an Auto Scaling trigger or a CloudWatch alarm, you can target that no more than 1 percent of requests take longer than 2 ms to process\.

## View CloudWatch metrics for your load balancer<a name="view-metric-data"></a>

You can view the CloudWatch metrics for your load balancers using the Amazon EC2 console\. These metrics are displayed as monitoring graphs\. The monitoring graphs show data points if the load balancer is active and receiving requests\.

Alternatively, you can view metrics for your load balancer using the CloudWatch console\.

**To view metrics using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. To view metrics filtered by target group, do the following:

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Target Groups**\.

   1. Select your target group, and then choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

   1. \(Optional\) To filter the results by time, select a time range from **Showing data for**\.

   1. To get a larger view of a single metric, select its graph\.

1. To view metrics filtered by load balancer, do the following:

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Load Balancers**\.

   1. Select your load balancer, and then choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

   1. \(Optional\) To filter the results by time, select a time range from **Showing data for**\.

   1. To get a larger view of a single metric, select its graph\.

**To view metrics using the CloudWatch console**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. Select the **ApplicationELB** namespace\.

1. \(Optional\) To view a metric across all dimensions, enter its name in the search field\.

1. \(Optional\) To filter by dimension, select one of the following:
   + To display only the metrics reported for your load balancers, choose **Per AppELB Metrics**\. To view the metrics for a single load balancer, enter its name in the search field\.
   + To display only the metrics reported for your target groups, choose **Per AppELB, per TG Metrics**\. To view the metrics for a single target group, enter its name in the search field\.
   + To display only the metrics reported for your load balancers by Availability Zone, choose **Per AppELB, per AZ Metrics**\. To view the metrics for a single load balancer, enter its name in the search field\. To view the metrics for a single Availability Zone, enter its name in the search field\.
   + To display only the metrics reported for your load balancers by Availability Zone and target group, choose **Per AppELB, per AZ, per TG Metrics**\. To view the metrics for a single load balancer, enter its name in the search field\. To view the metrics for a single target group, enter its name in the search field\. To view the metrics for a single Availability Zone, enter its name in the search field\.

**To view metrics using the AWS CLI**  
Use the following [list\-metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.html) command to list the available metrics:

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/ApplicationELB
```

**To get the statistics for a metric using the AWS CLI**  
Use the following [get\-metric\-statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.html) command get statistics for the specified metric and dimension\. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric\. You can't retrieve statistics using combinations of dimensions that were not specially published\. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created\.

```
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/ApplicationELB \
--metric-name UnHealthyHostCount --statistics Average  --period 3600 \
--dimensions Name=LoadBalancer,Value=app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \
Name=TargetGroup,Value=targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067 \
--start-time 2016-04-18T00:00:00Z --end-time 2016-04-21T00:00:00Z
```

The following is example output:

```
