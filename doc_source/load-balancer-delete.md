# Delete an Application Load Balancer<a name="load-balancer-delete"></a>

As soon as your load balancer becomes available, you are billed for each hour or partial hour that you keep it running\. When you no longer need the load balancer, you can delete it\. As soon as the load balancer is deleted, you stop incurring charges for it\.

You can't delete a load balancer if deletion protection is enabled\. For more information, see [Deletion protection](application-load-balancers.md#deletion-protection)\.

Note that deleting a load balancer does not affect its registered targets\. For example, your EC2 instances continue to run and are still registered to their target groups\. To delete your target groups, see [Delete a target group](delete-target-group.md)\.
